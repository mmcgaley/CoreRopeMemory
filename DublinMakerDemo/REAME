The DublinMakerDemo of my Core Rope Memory (CRM) project consists of a 5-bit piece of CRM, and some equipment for reading its contents. There is a pulse generator based on a 555 timer chip, with a probe for connecting to the rope-lines of the memory. The bit lines plug directly into an array of smoothing circuits which are connected to an Adruino Uno via a multiplexer. (The Arduino Uno does not have enough analog pins to accomodate the 5-bits as well as the display). Also connected to the Arduino Uno is a quad alphnumeric display (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1911).
