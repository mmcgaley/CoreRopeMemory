# CoreRopeMemory

This repository is for files related to my Core Rope Memory project. It includes the Arduino code that reads the contents of a piece of 5-bit memory, interprets those values as capital-letters in ASCII, and displays it to a quad alphanumeric display (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1911).

Also included is some PHP for converting a phrase into either standard 7-bit ASCII or PrettyBits (the encoding I developed for this project -- see http://www.timui.org/2015/04/pretty-bits.html
