# CoreRopeMemory

This repository is for files related to my Core Rope Memory project. It includes the Arduino code that reads the contents of a piece of 5-bit memory, interprets those values as capital-letters in ASCII, and displays it to a quad alphanumeric display (https://www.adafruit.com/products/1911).
